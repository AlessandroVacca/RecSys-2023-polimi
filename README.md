## Challenge description
The application domain was book recommendation. The datasets that were provided contained interactions of users with books, in particular, if the user attributed to the book a rating of at least 4. The main goal of the competition was to discover which items (books) a user will interact with. Thus, the challenge consisted in a pure collaborative filtering problem, since no ICM was provided. The evaluation metric was Mean Average Precision @ 10.
